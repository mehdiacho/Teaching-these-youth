## **Transfer Fortnite Update via Ethernet Cable**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Ethernet Cable**: Ensure you have a functional Ethernet cable.
- **Two Windows PCs**: One with the updated Fortnite and the other needing the update.
- **Administrative Access**: You need admin rights on both computers.

### **Step 1: Connect Both PCs Using the Ethernet Cable**

1. **Direct Connection**:
   - Plug one end of the Ethernet cable into the Ethernet port of your PC.
   - Plug the other end into your friend's PC.

2. **Network Configuration**:
   - Windows should automatically detect the direct connection. If not, you might need to set static IP addresses.
   - **Set Static IPs**:
     - **On Your PC**:
       - Go to **Settings** > **Network & Internet** > **Ethernet**.
       - Click on the connected Ethernet network.
       - Set **IP assignment** to **Manual**.
       - Toggle **IPv4** on and enter:
         - **IP address**: `192.168.1.1`
         - **Subnet mask**: `255.255.255.0`
     - **On Friend's PC**:
       - Repeat the above steps with:
         - **IP address**: `192.168.1.2`
         - **Subnet mask**: `255.255.255.0`

### **Step 2: Share the Fortnite Installation Folder**

1. **Locate Fortnite Folder**:
   - Typically found at: `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Fortnite`

2. **Share the Folder**:
   - Right-click the **Fortnite** folder.
   - Select **Properties** > **Sharing** tab.
   - Click on **Advanced Sharing**.
   - Check **Share this folder**.
   - Click on **Permissions** and ensure **Read** access is granted.
   - Click **OK** to apply settings.

### **Step 3: Access the Shared Folder from Your PC**

1. **Open File Explorer**:
   - Press `Win + E` to open File Explorer.

2. **Navigate to Network**:
   - Click on **Network** in the left pane.
   - You should see your friend's PC listed. If not, enter the IP address directly:
     - In the address bar, type `\\192.168.1.2\Fortnite` and press **Enter**.

3. **Copy the Fortnite Folder**:
   - Select the **Fortnite** folder and copy it (`Ctrl + C`).

4. **Paste to Your PC**:
   - Navigate to your Fortnite installation directory, typically `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\`.
   - Paste the folder (`Ctrl + V`). This will transfer the 70GB update.

### **Step 4: Verify and Launch Fortnite**

1. **Open Epic Games Launcher**:
   - The launcher should detect the existing Fortnite files.

2. **Verify Files**:
   - Click on **Library**.
   - Click the **Settings** (gear icon) next to Fortnite.
   - Scroll down and click **Verify**. This ensures all files are correctly in place.

3. **Launch Fortnite**:
   - Once verification is complete, you can launch the game without needing to download the update again.

### **Estimated Transfer Time**

- **Ethernet Speed**: Typically, a Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps) connection.
- **Data Size**: 70 GB.
- **Calculation**:
  - **1 Gbps** = **125 MB/s**.
  - **70 GB** = **70,000 MB**.
  - **Time** = `70,000 MB / 125 MB/s` = **560 seconds** (~9.3 minutes).

**Note**: Actual transfer speeds may vary based on system performance and network overhead. Expect approximately **10-15 minutes** for the transfer under optimal conditions.

## **Additional Tips**

- **Ensure Both PCs are Idle**: To maximize transfer speeds, minimize other network activities on both computers.
- **Use a Quality Ethernet Cable**: Cat5e or higher is recommended for Gigabit speeds.
- **Firewall Settings**: If you encounter issues accessing the shared folder, ensure that Windows Firewall allows file sharing on both PCs.
